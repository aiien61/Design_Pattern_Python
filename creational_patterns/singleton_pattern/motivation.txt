Singleton design pattern: 
A component which is instantiated only once

Reasons to use singleton design pattern

1. For some components it only makes sense to have one in the system: 
- database repository
- object factory

2. The initialiser call is expensive
- only do it once
- provide everyone with the same instance

3. Want to prevent anyone creating additional copies

4. Need to take care of lazy instantiation
